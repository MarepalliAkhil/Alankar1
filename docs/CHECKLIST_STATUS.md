# Alankar: checklist status (audit, second pass)

Updated 2026-11-06. This pass replaces every "See PROGRESS" row with sub-items checked against the real code and test files. PROGRESS.md was used only to find names, never as proof.

Legend: **C** = code exists, **T** = tests exist (names given), **R** = I ran it here and it passed, **B** = seen in a browser (never, no browser here).

Status rules:
- **DONE**: code + tests + I ran the tests here and they passed (frontend only; still not seen in a browser).
- **UNVERIFIED**: code and tests exist but the check could not be run here. Every backend row is UNVERIFIED because PyPI is blocked in this environment, so pytest cannot run. Playwright/axe rows are UNVERIFIED for the same kind of reason.
- **PARTIAL**: part of it exists.
- **NOT STARTED**: no code found.

Counts below are **counted from files** (`def test_`, `it(`, `Intent(`), not from a passing run, unless a row says R.

## 1. Summary counts

DONE: 29, PARTIAL: 7, NOT STARTED: 14, UNVERIFIED: 40 (total 90; "DONE" always means unit tests passed or a file check, never seen in a browser)

What ran in this pass (R): the whole frontend vitest suite (794 of 795 passed; the one failure was the generated repo-stats file going stale after my changes, regenerated on your PC copy with `node scripts/repo-stats.mjs`, not re-run in the sandbox), tsc on the changed files (only unrelated `recharts` typing errors from the sandbox's incomplete node_modules), eslint and prettier on the changed files (clean). Not run: backend pytest, Playwright, `npm run build`, anything in a browser.

## 2. Full checklist

## 3. Conflicts between docs and code, and the T10 reconciliation

**T10 versus AI-1 (resolved).** Two different things share the name "Alankar Intelligence":

- **The public chatbot, "AI Alankar Intelligence" (Task 7).** BUILT. backend/chatbot/ (engine/ with normalize, spell-correct, stem, synonyms, entities, 42 intents, BM25 search; api.py; admin_api.py; defaults.py; tools.py), the corner widget, the admin ChatbotInsightsPage, 64 backend tests (counted). Deterministic, no LLM.
- **The admin assistant (Task 10 / Part 3).** NOT BUILT. There is no learn_daily, daily briefing, plans, confirmed commands, 25+ business rules or admin UI. PROGRESS lines 1779 to 1787 and 2158 say this correctly. My earlier row "AI-1 core code and tests exist" described the public chatbot and was misleading.

Other conflicts:

- Git remote: `git remote -v` prints nothing, yet `git log` shows `origin/main` (a leftover ref). Nothing is backed up from this PC until you add a remote. My first audit said "no remote", which is right for `git remote -v`.
- PROGRESS said hero.ts "is unused (kept)". It is now deleted with its test; the mentions in PROGRESS.md were updated.
- The old Meera docs implied a booking-submitted screen and a skip-confirmation. The screen is now built; the skip-confirmation is dropped (not built, removed from the docs).
- "ZenFlow" was described as the platform name in MASTER_NOTES, CLAUDE.md and README.md. Users now see Alankar. ZenFlow remains in those internal docs only as the working name.
- Test counts in PROGRESS and repo-stats are counted from files. Per area (counted `def test_`): accounts 161, billing 166, chat 56, chatbot 64, core 91, inventory 16, people 116, scheduling 128, shop 26, waitlist 19, wallet 81, website 60 (= 984) plus 4 new in notifications = 988. Frontend: repo-stats says 569 unit and 82 e2e. My own grep found 74 e2e cases because some are generated with loops.
- Admin had a bell but no notification actions: fixed in this pass.
- Contradiction inside CLAUDE.md-era docs: "Do not commit" (your rule) versus the Stop hook demanding a commit. I follow your rule.

## 4. Failing or unverified checks: commands for your PC (cmd.exe)

```
cd /d "C:\Users\akhim\Downloads\salon-app-starter-kit (1)\salon-app\salon-app\backend"
python -m pytest -q
python -m pytest -q notifications/tests/test_admin_notifications.py core/tests/test_foundation.py core/tests/test_policy.py core/tests/test_sweep.py

cd /d "C:\Users\akhim\Downloads\salon-app-starter-kit (1)\salon-app\salon-app\frontend"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run typecheck:e2e
npm test
npm run build
npx playwright test
npx playwright test e2e/axe.e2e.ts
```

## 5. Cleanup done in this pass

Deleted (you named these; nothing referenced them except the old sync lists):

| Item | Size |
|---|---|
| _sync/ (t15_assets.tar 14,039,040 bytes, local_md5.txt) | about 14 MB |
| Claude outputs/alankar-sandbox-sync.tar.gz (folder removed, now empty) | 950,681 bytes |
| _to_delete/_incoming_2c_otp.tgz (folder removed, now empty) | 84,748 bytes |
| "tatus --short" (a pasted git log) | 736 bytes |
| frontend/photos-originals/_in5.tgz, _in6.tgz, _pull.tgz, _bmd5.txt (the _sync folder there was already gone) | 53,439 + 4,764 + 1,079,449 + 31,589 bytes |
| frontend/src/design/hero.ts and hero.test.ts (dead code; the test would not compile without it) | 77 + 76 lines |

Not deleted: any screenshot, photo, original, pose PNG, source file or doc. Left alone: frontend/photos-originals/_sheet.png (722,923 bytes; not named by you, not mine to remove).

.gitignore: bulk screenshots in docs/ui-screenshots are now ignored except the curated set (t15-before-*, t15-after-c-*, staff-myday-*, staff-nav-fixed-768.png, 84 files). 225 of the 309 tracked screenshots (about 100 MB) are no longer wanted in git. Also ignored: _sync/, _to_delete/, Claude outputs/, *.tgz, *.tar.gz.

Exact commands to untrack (files stay on disk):

```
cd /d "C:\Users\akhim\Downloads\salon-app-starter-kit (1)\salon-app\salon-app"
git rm -r --cached -q docs/ui-screenshots
git add docs/ui-screenshots
git rm -r --cached -q --ignore-unmatch _sync "Claude outputs" _to_delete "tatus --short"
git status --short
```

The first two lines drop every screenshot from the index and re-add only the ones the new .gitignore allows.

20 largest tracked files (before cleanup, bytes): _sync/t15_assets.tar 14,039,040; docs/ui-screenshots/t14-dash-1280-light.png 1,652,251; t14-dash-1280-dark.png 1,492,882; frontend/public/photos/meera/meera.png 1,157,739; t14-sb-stylist-1280.png 1,047,652; chat-photo-stylist-badge-1280-light.png 1,030,267; t14-dash-375-light.png 1,026,626; after17b-stylist-1280-light.png 1,013,963; after17d-stylist-requests.png 1,010,823; after17d-receptionist-appointments.png 999,933; after-stylist-appts-1280-light.png 963,377; Claude outputs/alankar-sandbox-sync.tar.gz 950,681; chat-photo-stylist-badge-1280-dark.png 950,440; after17b-receptionist-1280-light.png 941,910; after17b-stylist-1280-dark.png 929,482; after-admin-dash-1280-light.png 916,208; t14-sb-receptionist-1280.png 913,761; home-sections-light.png 873,701; after17b-receptionist-1280-dark.png 863,638; after17d-admin-payroll.png 848,634. Only meera.png (the default Meera picture, which you asked to keep) is a legitimate large file.

## 6. Risks

- Nothing is backed up off this PC (no git remote).
- Security scans still to run on your PC: tracked .env (`git ls-files | findstr /i "\.env"`), TODO/FIXME (`git grep -n "TODO\|FIXME"`). .env is in .gitignore.
- backend/.venv is on disk (Windows virtualenv). It is ignored by .gitignore (`.venv/`).
- scripts/photos-optimize.mjs was never run here (sharp unavailable).
- The admin policy change (notifications) needs the backend suite to confirm test_sweep and test_policy still pass, because they enumerate every action for every role.
